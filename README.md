FileRouter
==========

FileRouter is a project intended to build a usable B2B file transfer gateway.
It works around the concept of Repositories, Jobs, and Transmissions.

Jobs are created and scheduled to copy files from a source repository in to one or more destinations,
creting a transmission record for monitoring purposes.
